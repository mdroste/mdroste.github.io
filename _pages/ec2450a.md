##### Section Materials for Economics 2450A: Public Economics and Fiscal Policy I

These are the section materials I used as a teaching assistant for Harvard's Economics 2450A, the first in Harvard's two-semester graduate public economics sequence, in Fall 2022. This course was taught by [Stefanie Stantcheva](https://scholar.harvard.edu/stantcheva/home), and notably focuses heavily on optimal tax theory.
