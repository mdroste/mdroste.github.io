##### Section Materials for Economics 2450A: Public Economics and Fiscal Policy I

These are the section slides I wrote as a teaching fellow for Harvard's Economics 2450A, the first half of Harvard's two-semester graduate public economics sequence, in Fall 2022. This course was taught by [Stefanie Stantcheva](https://scholar.harvard.edu/stantcheva/home), and notably is focused heavily on optimal tax theory. 

These section slides closely follow along with Stefanie Stantcheva's lecture slides, which she has kindly posted online [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/stantcheva/classes/ec-2450a-public-economics-and).
